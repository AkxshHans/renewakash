                <h3>Our Story: <br> From Passion to Profession</h3>
                <h5>Backdrope began as a dream, driven by the passion and vision of Madhvan, a mechanical engineer who decided to take a leap of faith and follow his heart into the world of photography. After leaving a stable engineering career, Madhvan sought to channel his creativity into something that truly resonated with him—capturing life’s moments through the lens of a camera. But the journey wasn’t meant to be a solo one.

                    Realizing the power of collaboration, Madhvan reached out to a group of like-minded friends, each equally passionate and already freelancing in various creative fields—photography, cinematography, designing, digital marketing, website development, and editing. He pitched them the idea of uniting under one umbrella to provide a comprehensive suite of creative services. The response was overwhelming, as every friend immediately said "yes" to joining this collective vision.
                    
                    With that, Backdrope was born. Our team is composed of professionals who have turned their individual passions into a shared mission: to provide end-to-end services for projects, events, special occasions, and brand building. We don’t just take on projects; we immerse ourselves in them, ensuring that each one reflects our deep commitment to quality and client satisfaction.</h5>
